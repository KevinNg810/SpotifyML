# SpotifyML
## What is this?
This program learns a user’s music preferences by parsing and pulling a user’s Spotify account (Recently Played/Current Playlists) and comparing the playlists with other users to guess which user listened to a song.
## How it works?
We utilized the Spotipy API which breaks down songs into 8 sound attributes (Danceability, Energy, Mode, Speechiness, Acousticness, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Valence). The program learns our music preferences by training it with our individual datasets and finding the average of each of the sound attributes.
## What next?
To build a front end application and user interface
